This is a minimal Kotlin Android app skeleton converted from the ClearFinance React PWA.

- Single-activity Jetpack Compose app
- Room-based persistence (transactions stored locally in SQLite)
- Screens: Tracker (default), Analysis (placeholder), Records, More

To build and run open the project in Android Studio and import the Gradle project at kotlin-app/settings.gradle.kts. The app targets API 24+ and uses Kotlin, Compose and Room.
